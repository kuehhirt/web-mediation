Do negative campaign ads help politicians win elections? Are there learning benefits to regular course attendance at university? Is maternal employment bad for children's development and, if so, why? If you are interested in answering such or similar questions, you are in the business of causal inference; your aim is to use empirical data to learn about causal relations between specific variables. 

This course provides an introduction to the state-of-the-art theory and practice for causal inference. It goes beyond the notion that statistical association doesn't necessarily imply causation and specifies precisely under which conditions we can interpret statistical associations as estimates of causal effects. In addition to conventional regression approaches the course introduces inverse probability weighting as a useful alternative technique for causal inference. The main topics of the course are the construction and application of graphical causal models, the precise definition of causal effects in terms of interventions and counterfactual variables, and the conditions and techniques for estimating total effects, direct and indirect effects (i.e., mediation analysis), and the effects of time-varying variables. 

The focus is never on the mathematical derivation of statistical methods, but on an intuition for the conditions under which these methods allow valid causal inference, and for the scenarios under which they break down. Providing step-by-step practical guidance for (1) specifying prior knowledge and assumptions about the variables of interest, for (2) defining the effect to be estimated, for (3) assessing whether this effect can be estimated with given data, and for (4) statistical estimation (in `Stata`) and (5) interpretation of the results, this course will strengthen your ability to evaluate existing research, aid you in the formulation of precise and novel research questions, and provide tools for answering them. To facilitate learning, theoretical lectures are complemented with exercises and practical `Stata` labs.
